#Socket Programing "Reliable-Transport-Protocal"

Reliable Transport Protocal  using UDP 
The problem of reliable data transfer is of central importance in networking. A reliable
data transfer protocol provides upper layer entities with the service abstraction of a
reliable channel through which data can be transferred. The task is made difficult by the
fact that the channel is unreliable and it is the task of the reliable data transfer protocol
to deal with unreliability problems: packet loss, packet corruption and out-of-order
packets.
Referring to section 3.4.1 in the textbook, you can find some protocols for reliable data
transmission. These protocols are called stop-and-wait automatic repeat request
(ARQ) and they support error detection, receiver feedback, and the possibility of packet
retransmission.
